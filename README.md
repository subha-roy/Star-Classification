# Star-Classification
## Overview: 
Developed and Executed a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning algorithms for star classification, focusing on optimising performance with a dataset of 240 stars.
## •	Predictive Modeling: 
Achieved 92% classification accuracy using a Decision Tree model optimised with GridSearchCV, demonstrating expertise in hyperparameter tuning and predictive modeling.
## •	Data Augmentation: 
Addressed data imbalance by expanding the dataset to 777 records using RandomOverSampler, enhancing model reliability and robustness.
## •	Algorithm Comparison: 
Developed and compared  models (Decision Tree, KMeans, MLP, CNN), achieving a 15% improvement in performance metrics through rigorous model evaluation and optimisation.
